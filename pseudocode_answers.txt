Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Pseudocode allows programmers to figure out how to solve a problem before creating any code. In provides the opportunity to think about what the problem is, and what steps are needed. 
 
2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
It would throw errors and the computer would not understand this language.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:
1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

READ two_numbers
IF first_number > than second_number
PRINT first_number
ELSE
PRINT second_number

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

START count at 1
WHILE count is <= 100
PRINT count
INCREMENT count by 1
ENDWHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

WHILE Gustaf != entry in phoneBook
REPEAT comparing Gustaf to entries in phoneBook
ELSE ENDWHILE

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

function findGustaf(phoneBook) {
  while (‘Gustaf’ != phoneBook) {
    count++;
  } else{
  console.log(’Found you Gustaf!’);
  break;  
}
